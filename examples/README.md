===========
These examples are out of date. They will be updated in time, but please refer to the Readme in the main directory for now.

These are examples of how to use upnpclient. Since these examples are dependant
on actual physical devices on your network, they will probably not work for
you. 

Examples can be run with the `run.sh` file:

    $ ./run.sh discover.py

The following examples are included:

*   `discover.py`

    Discover UPnP devices on the network and print some info.

*   `server.py`

    Directly connect to an UPnP device without discovery.

*   `action_call.py`

    Find and call an action on an UPnP device.

*   `upnp_dump.py`

    Discover all UPnP devices and list all their actions including parameters, etc.
