GUI uPnP Browser
================

This GUI is very much a work in progress, and probably doesn't work.

### Current Features
- Connect to a specific device
- Scan network for devices
- Display device services and actions in a tree
- Double-click on actions which require no arguments to call them and see results in pop-up window
